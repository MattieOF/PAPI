- [x] Layer system - or something so applications can start to do stuff with the "core".
- [ ] ImGUI for debug UI
	- [x] Add to project
	- [x] Initialise context, etc. 
	- [x] Hook up to rendering
    - [x] Add custom font.
	- [ ] Add a nice way for entities and other places to add debugging windows or values.

  - [ ] Better collision system
  - [ ] Event system
  - [ ] Provision for multiplayer sided-ness; relevancy.
- [ ] Basic asset system?
- [ ] Text rendering
	- [ ] Add freetype, msdfgen
	- [ ] MSDF atlas generation
	- [ ] Cache atlases 
	- [ ] Shader
	- [ ] Rendering functions
- [ ] Audio system
